# Oxygen OS — Web Desktop Environment

![Oxygen OS preview](https://storage.googleapis.com/gpt-engineer-file-uploads/0dzo8X4MleM7J7EgLJREe3vPEYe2/social-images/social-1761293818463-1000173508.jpg)

Oxygen OS is a lightweight, fully functional desktop environment that runs entirely in your browser. It provides a familiar desktop experience with a set of built-in applications and a customizable settings panel — no native install required.

Built for experimenting with web-based user interfaces and browser-first operating system concepts, Oxygen OS showcases a simple, extendable web desktop with common utilities.

## Technologies

Oxygen OS is built with modern web technologies and follows a component-driven approach. The repository uses TypeScript and a module-based entry (see `src/main.tsx`), and is intended to run as a single-page web application.
